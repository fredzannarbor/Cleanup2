Cleanup² is a native iOS app that transforms the overwhelming task of decluttering your home into a structured, room-by-room process — then keeps your spaces clean with recurring task schedules.

DECLUTTER ROOM BY ROOM

Go through every room in your home and catalog what's there. Categorize each item as Keep, Donate, Trash, or Sell. Mark furniture separately. Use voice input, video scanning, or clipboard import to add items quickly. Bulk categorize to fly through large inventories.

TRANSITION TO CLEANING MODE

Once a room is fully decluttered, Cleanup² automatically generates a customized cleaning schedule based on the room type — daily, weekly, and monthly tasks appropriate for kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and more.

TRACK YOUR PROGRESS

Visual dashboards show your decluttering progress across all rooms with bar charts, category pie charts, cleaning streaks, and activity calendars. See exactly how many items you've processed, donated, sold, and trashed.
